Installing iotPOS on the Raspberry Pi

To compile and install:

* First make sure you have kde4 installed (kdelibs4, kdebase4, kdepimlibs4) and all of his
  dependencies (qt4...):
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install kde-standard libqt4-dev

While kde is installed, it will prompt you to either choose LightDM or KDE. Being that we already have LXDE, we can choose LightDM since it has less resouces to install.

Once you have KDE, and QT4 installed, we can install mysql:
  sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server
  sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ cmake gettext libqt4-sql-mysql kdelibs5-dev
 
 The next step is to download the source:
 
  git clone https://github.com/hiramvillarreal/iotpos
  cd iotpos 
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=kde4-config --prefix -DQT_QMAKE_EXECUTABLE=which qmake-qt4 -DQT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/qt4 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
  make
  su
  make install
  
  Now, copy the lemonrc file to your local .kde/share/config directory:
  
  cp iotpos/src/lemonrc /home/pi/.kde/share/config/  #Replace USER with your username.
  
* After installation, you need to create a database and user on mysql, to do this:

  cd lemonpos/database_resources
  cat lemon_mysql.sql | mysql -u root -p
  
  
* To start using lemon, type 

  lemon
  
  If for any reason lemon binary is not found, and if your kde4 install path is /opt/kde4 do:
  
  /opt/kde4/bin/lemon
  
 * The default and only user and password is (without quotation marks):
 
   username: "admin"
   password: "linux"

  By default, squeeze has security disabled, this to let you configure squeeze database settings in case
  you have installed the database server at a different computer.
